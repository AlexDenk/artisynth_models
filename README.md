# OpenSim-based full-body multibody model built in Artisynth
This repository holds a fork of the original [artisynth_models](https://github.com/artisynth/artisynth_models) repository by John Lloyd containing a full-body model based on the gait2392.osim model in OpenSim. The model was built using the freely available 3D modelling platform [ArtiSynth](https://www.artisynth.org/Main/HomePage). The model is intended for combined multi-body and finite element simulations and contains contact and constraint definitions.

If you use the model or parts of it in your research, please cite the following reference:
