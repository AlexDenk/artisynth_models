Oracle has an online Java tutorial located at

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial

For ArtiSynth development purposes, we recommend studying the following
topics under "Trails Covering the Basics":

* Getting Started

The tutorial suggests using the NetBeans IDE (integrated development
environment). Most current ArtiSynth users work with the Eclipse IDE,
and Eclipse is the IDE discussed in the ArtiSynth install documentation.
However, you can use any IDE you like.

* Learning the Java language

Try to learn everything here, except for maybe just skimming the Generics
section, which is likely to be more difficult. You should know enough about
generics to understand what it means to qualifier a generic class with a 
type (e.g., ArrayList<Point3d>, ArrayList<Matrix>, HashMap<String,Double>).

* Essential Java Classes

Study the sections on Exceptions and Basic I/O.

* Collections

Study the Introduction, Interfaces, and Implementations. The main collection
implementations that you need to know about are ArrayList<>, HashSet<> and 
HashMap<>. Trees and Deques you almost certainly won't need.

The example codes "TestFEM" and "OpenSimTest" are commented on for new 
users to understand the basic structure of Artisynth models. Particularly 
useful reference material includes the web-based Artisynth manual
(https://www.artisynth.org/manuals/index.jsp), with the following chapters 
being crucial:
