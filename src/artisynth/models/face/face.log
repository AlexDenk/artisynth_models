- conformed face to skull: set gravit=0, fix outer surface, chopped zygomatic process off of maxilla mesh because of large lateral face interpenetration, translate and collide maxilla mesh into inner surface of face, one point on the inner lateral side of the mesh poked out badly
- added right sided muscles: delete right-side markers (because not symmteric after conforming to skull)
- modified upper part of OOP to align with middle layer or elements as opposed to along inner surface
- tested OOP activation: good lower lip protrusion, no upper lip protrusion, no inward movement of lip corners

--- Nov. 19
- added "updated_muscles.node" (now called face_muscles_yohan.node), removed face_muscles_ian.node because updated version fixed OOP problem
- added explicit ansys points to close OOP:
upper OOP midpoint (adjacent to 114121): 134227    0.048461895   0.000000  0.10907037
lower OOP midpoint (adjacent to 114136): 134228    0.056953946   0.000000  0.079245391
